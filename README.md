# Inner Engineering App
This app can be best viewed at : https://inner-engineering-client.divyanat2009.vercel.app/

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Summary

Inspired by my mother and sister, this repo contains the files for an app created to motivate and inspire users to take care for themselves and keep a track of daily activities.
Users can log their daily selfcare and gratitude, set goals for themselves, and celebrate their progress.

    <p>
      Inner Engineering is a technology for well-being derived from the science of Yoga. It is a comprehensive outlook to personal growth that brings about a shift in the way you perceive and experience your life, your work, and the world that you live in.

    <p>
      We believe in a holistic approach to wellness and encourage tapping into your unique beauty in these four areas: Energy-(the food we eat), Physical-(exercise/ meditation), Emotional Wellbeing and Spiritual Growth.

      This app provides a place for you to set goals, celebrate your progress, and find ideas for inspiration. We have also included an online gratitude journal - because the more you can appreciate what you already have, the more you love yourself and the world.
